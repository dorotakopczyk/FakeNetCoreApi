# This is a sample NetCore API 
This is a simple CRUD API with API documentation:
https://sampleapiappdorttest.azurewebsites.net/swagger/index.html

This is what provides a UI for the documentation:
https://swagger.io/docs/specification/about/

In the future if I had more time I would have:
1) Completed writing tests whereas I just stubbed them out 
2) Fleshed out v2 of my API 
3) Added an exception handler 
4) Instead of using an in memory db, I would have created a database solution too. 
5) Added more business logic on handing crud functionality
